        Niagara Falls (/naɪˈæɡərə/) is a group of three waterfalls at the
        southern end of Niagara Gorge, spanning the border between the province
        of Ontario in Canada and the state of New York in the United States. The
        largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls, which straddles the
        international border of the two countries. It is also known as the
        Canadian Falls. The smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie
        within the United States. Bridal Veil Falls is separated from Horseshoe
        Falls by Goat Island and from American Falls by Luna Island, with both
        islands situated in New York.
